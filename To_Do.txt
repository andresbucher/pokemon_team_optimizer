0. see if we can use database_checker or cleaner in General? 


1.
check if all pokemon are there (use pokemon_images(old)) for reference and naming convention
check all forms (and if image is true)
check if naming convention is correct

2. change random image to normal fixed image
3. check if "image checker" works (so no duplicate will get downloaded)
